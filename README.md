# Transfer-Learning-Oxford-102-Flower-dataset-Classification

We used Keras to create models that classify the image into the appropriate category.  

For this assignment, we used the repository - https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/ - this is a dataset that contains flowersâ€™s images of 102 categories.  
We worked with Kaggle Kernels in order to work with the many images and neural network.  
The algorithm is written in Python.  

We used pre-trained models: VGG16 and Xception
